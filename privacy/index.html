<p>Effective January 1, 2025</p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our mission is to make transaction tax compliance easier and fundamentally better. WonderTax Labs is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals whose personal data we collect (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;). WonderTax Labs may collect personal data from individuals who register to use WonderTax Labs's services, applications, and programs (&quot;Services&quot;), visitors to our website, individuals who request information, prospective customers, and event attendees. This Privacy Notice describes how WonderTax Labs and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (&quot;WonderTax Labs&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) collect, use, and disclose personal data, and the choices WonderTax Labs offers regarding its collection and use of personal data.</p>
<h2 id="personal-data-collected">Personal Data Collected</h2>
<p><strong>Data collected from you:</strong>
WonderTax Labs collects personal data directly from you, for instance when you inquire about one of WonderTax Labs's Services or send an email to WonderTax Labs, or from your interactions with our website, products or Services. Details include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contact details.</strong> When you inquire about our Services, register for an event or seminar, download content like white papers, communicate with us by email, or enter a live chat, we may collect your contact details, such as your name, company, address, phone number, and email address.

<li><strong>Account creation.</strong> When you create an account with us via our website, we may collect your contact details and a password (technically, we would never &quot;collect&quot; your password, rather we would store the SHA256 hash of that password).</li>
<li><strong>Billing data.</strong> When you purchase Services or register to attend an event, we may collect billing and payment information.</li>
<li><strong>Device and usage data.</strong> When you use our website or our Services, we may also automatically collect data about your device and about your usage of and activity on our website and Services.
